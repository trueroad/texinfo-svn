The Texinfo JS Interface is an attempt to make browsing features
provided by the Info mode of Emacs and the @command{info} program
available to read HTML manuals in a standard web browser.  These 
features include:
@c should mention some free software web browsers here

@itemize
@item Fast index lookup using the @key{i} key.
@item Navigation using @key{n}, @key{p} and @key{u}
@end itemize

To see a list of available commands while reading a manual using
the Texinfo JS Interface, click on the `?'@: symbol in the top 
right-hand
corner.

To add the Texinfo JS Interface to HTML
manuals generated from Texinfo, use the @command{texi2any-js} command.
For example:

@example
texi2any-js elisp.texi
@end example

@noindent The HTML manual is created in the @code{elisp-html} directory.

Any extra arguments given to @command{texi2any-js} are passed on to
@command{texi2any}.  For example:

@example
texi2any-js elisp.texi --css-ref=kawa.css
@end example

@noindent causes the @file{kawa.css} CSS file to be referenced in the
HTML files which are output.


@node History
@appendix History

The Texinfo JS Interface was created by Matthieu Lirzin in 2017 as part
of a Google Summer of Code project.  Advice was given by Per Bothner and 
Gavin Smith.
